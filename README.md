# Code Every Day

My personal challenge to spend at least an hour coding every day.

## My rules
1. All learning must be active. If I am watching a video or working through exercise I should
    - Take notes along side
    - Do all exercises
2. I must spend at least 30 mins actually *coding* outside of active coding.
This can be on code challenges or projects.
3. I should commit publically everything I am working on. This means working on code challenges locally too so that I can track progress and reflect back.

## When should I stop?

Let's set a 10 week target whilst we are still partially locked down and review at that date. (Plus it fits nicely below)
